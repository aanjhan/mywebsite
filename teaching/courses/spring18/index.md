### Course Description
Recent years have seen massive deployment of wireless devices and technologies around us. They are deployed in a wide variety of systems such as telephony, navigation, sensor networks, critical infrastructures etc. With the advent of the Internet of Things and autonomous cyber-physical systems, the proliferation of these wireless systems are only bound to increase. The broadcast nature of wireless technologies and the increased availabiloty of software defined radios have not only improved quality of life but pose significant security challenges. In particular, the course would cover the following topics:

- Basic security notions
- Wireless communication basics
- Jamming/Anti-jamming techniques, eavesdropping, insertion/modification, wireless channel based Key Agreement
- Secure localization and proximity verification
- Secure synchronization 
- Security of GNSS systems  (GPS, Galileo, Glonass)
- Security and privacy of 802.11 and Bluetooth technologies
- Broadcast authentication techniques
- Key distribution in sensor networks
- Security of modern communication systems: GSM/UMTS/LTE

**Course Objective**: After this course, the students should be able to describe and classify security goals and attacks in modern wireless networks. They should be able to identify the unique security implications of these effects and how to mitigate security issues associated with them.

### Prerequisites

Fundamental ideas in wireless communications and security notions preferable. Basic Matlab or Python programming skills will help in a couple of take home assignments (however not mandatory). Additional pre-requisites apply as mentioned in the respective course catalog entries.

### Reading Materials
There won't be any single text book for this course. Every lecture will contain pointers to recommended reading material. For students who are not familiar with relevant background, the following links/textbooks may help.

* Electronic Warfare 101, David Adamy
* [Complex to Real](complextoreal.com)
* [Software Defined Radio for the Masses (Part 1)](https://sites.google.com/site/thesdrinstitute/A-Software-Defined-Radio-for-the-Masses)
