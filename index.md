## Bio
Aanjhan is currently a post-doctoral researcher in the [System Security Group at ETH Zurich]. He obtained his PhD in 2016 under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Srdjan Capkun]. His research mostly revolves around the physical-layer security of wireless systems (e.g., secure localization and ranging, GPS security, (anti-) jamming techniques). In the past, he has worked on computer architectures, specifically, multiprocessor systems, cache coherency protocols and communication bus protocols.

Prior to joining the [System Security group at ETH Zurich], he worked at Robert Bosch GmbH's Car Multimedia Division "Blaupunkt" for over 3 years involved in research and development of embedded modules for top automotive manufacturers including Audi and Volkswagen. He holds a bachelors degree in Electronic and Communication engineering from Anna University in Chennai, India and a Masters degree in Microelectronics from [Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne], Switzerland.

**I am currently in the job market looking for interesting research positions in the broad area of wireless / hardware systems and their security. <a href="assets/cv_aanjhan.pdf">[CV]</a>**
