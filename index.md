## Bio

---
Aanjhan is an Assistant Professor in the [Khoury College of Computer Sciences] at [Northeastern University] in Boston, USA. He is also an affiliate faculty in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering]. His current research revolves around the security and privacy of wireless networks with a strong focus on autonomous cyber-physical systems and smart ecosystems. He has worked on a wide variety of topics including physical-layer security of wireless systems, secure localization and proximity verification, trusted computing architectures, and side-channels. He is a recipient of several awards including the outstanding dissertation award from ETH Zurich, regional winner of European Space Agency’s Satellite Navigation competition and the Cyber Award from Armasuisse (Switzerland’s Department of Defense). Prior to joining Northeastern, he was a senior researcher in the System Security group at ETH Zurich and has over 3 years of industry research experience as a senior engineer at Robert Bosch GmbH's Car Multimedia Division "Blaupunkt" where he was involved in the development of embedded modules for top automotive manufacturers including Audi and Volkswagen. He holds an M.Sc with specialization in Electronics and Microelectronics from [EPFL], Switzerland and a Ph.D in Computer Science from ETH Zurich, Switzerland.
