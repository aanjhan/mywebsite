### Research Projects

I am currently involved in the following research themes (projects).

#### Designing a wide area secure positioning system

Location information is gaining importance in emerging applications, such as civilian or military navigation, people or asset tracking, emergency rescue and support, mining, exploration, smart grids, and modern networking systems. However, existing solutions (such as GPS) are vulnerable to spoofing attacks and do not allow the locations reported by remote parties to be verified.

Our research focuses on the design and realization of a Wide-Area Secure Positioning System that allows locations to be securely computed and verified. More information on this project can be found [here](http://www.securepositioning.com).

#### Spoofing Aware GPS Receiver

The use of Global Positioning System (GPS) has become ubiquitous in a wide  variety of applications ranging from navigation and tracking to modern smart  grids and communication networks. Given the implications of both loss of  integrity or denial of service on these systems, it is important to secure GPS from attacks. Prior works have demonstrated the vulnerability of modern GPS receivers to signal spoofing attacks. Several countermeasures have been proposed for detecting or mitigating these attacks. However, the effectiveness of these countermeasures in real-world scenarios have not been evaluated. In this work, we present a *SPoofing AWare GPS receiver (SPAW)* capable of detecting majority of spoofing attacks described in the literature. We implement several spoofing detection techniques (both existing and novel) and evaluate their effectiveness both in real-world and against a publicly available repository of GPS spoofing scenarios.
